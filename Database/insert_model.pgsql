Additionally, decisions for risk acceptance are more informed, therefore better aligned to the business.

By starting with simple threat models and building application risk profiles, an organization improves over time. Ultimately, a sophisticated organization would maintain this information in a way that is tightly coupled to the compensating factors and pass-through risks from external entities. This provides greater breadth of understanding for potential downstream impacts from security issues while keeping a close watch on the organization’s current performance against known threats.

As an organization progresses, it builds a broad base of training starting with developers and moving to other roles, culminating with the addition of role-based training to ensure applicability and effectiveness.

In addition to training, this practice also requires the organization to make a significant investment in improving organizational culture to promote application security through collaboration between teams.

New security features and patches are regularly released for the various elements of the technology stack you''re using, until they become obsolete or are no longer supported.

Most of the technologies in any application stack are not secure by default. This is frequently intentional, to enhance backwards compatibility or ease of setup. For this reason, ensuring the secure operation of the organization''s technology stack requires the consistent application of secure baseline configurations to all components. The Environment Management (EM) practice focuses on keeping your environment clean and secure.

Vulnerabilities are discovered throughout the lifecycles of the technologies on which your organization relies, and new versions addressing them are released on various schedules. This makes it essential to monitor vulnerability reports and perform orderly, timely patching across all affected systems.

In this model, we define a security incident as a breach, or the threat of an imminent breach, of at least one asset''s security goals, whether due to malicious or negligent behavior. Examples of security incidents might include: a successful Denial of Service (DoS) attack against a cloud application, an application user accessing private data of another by abusing a security vulnerability, or an attacker modifying application source code. The Incident Management (IM) practice focuses on dealing with these in your organization.

Historically, many security incidents have been detected months, or even years, after the initial breach. During the "dwell time" before an incident is detected, significant damage can occur, increasing the difficulty of recovery. Our first activity stream, Incident Detection, focuses on decreasing that dwell time.

Once you have identified that you''re suffering from a security incident, it''s essential to respond in a disciplined, thorough manner to limit the damage, and return to normal operations as efficiently as possible. This is the focus of our second stream.

The goal of the Requirements-driven Testing (RT) practice is to ensure that the implemented security controls operate as expected and satisfy the project''s stated security requirements. It does so by incrementally building a set of security test and regression cases and executing them regularly.

A key aspect of this practice is its attention to both positive and negative testing. The former verifies that the application''s security controls satisfy stated security requirements and validates their correct functioning. These requirements are typically functional in nature. Negative testing addresses the quality of the implementation of the security controls and aims to detect unexpected design flaws and implementation bugs through misuse and abuse testing. In its more advanced forms, the practice promotes security stress testing, such as denial of service, and strives to continuously improve application security by consistently automating security unit tests and creating security regression tests for all bugs identified and fixed.

Although both the Requirements-driven Testing and Security Testing practices are concerned with security testing, the former focuses on verifying the correct implementation of security requirements, while the latter aims to uncover technical implementation weaknesses in an application, irrespective of requirements.

Each stream therefore has one approach at its core.

The first stream focuses on establishing a common security baseline to automatically detect so-called "low hanging fruit". Progressively customize the automated tests for each application and increase their frequency of execution to detect more bugs and regressions earlier, as close as possible to their inception. The more bugs the automated processes can detect, the more time experts have to use their knowledge and creativity to focus on more complex attack vectors and ensure in-depth application testing in the second stream. As manual review is slow and hard to scale, reviewers prioritize testing components based on their risk, recent relevant changes, or upcoming major releases. Organizations can also access external expertise by participating in bug bounty programs, for example.

Unlike the Requirements-driven testing practice which focuses on verifying that applications correctly implement their requirements, the goal of this practice is to uncover technical and business-logic weaknesses in application and make them visible to management and business stakeholders, irrespective of requirements.

Collect and evaluate reusable systems to assemble a list of such resources and categorize them by the security mechanism they fulfill. Consider each resource in terms of why a product team would want to integrate with it, i.e. the benefits of using the shared resource.

If multiple resources exist in each category, select and standardize on one or more shared services per category. Because future software development will rely on these services, review each thoroughly to ensure understanding of the baseline security posture. For each selected service, create design guidance for product teams to understand how to integrate with the system. Make the guidance available through training, mentorship, guidelines, and standards.

Establish a set of best practices representing sound methods of implementing security functionality. You can research them or purchase them, and it is often more effective if you customize them so they are more specific to your organization. Example patterns include a single-sign-on subsystem, a cross-tier delegation model, a separation-of-duties authorization model, a centralized logging pattern, etc.

These patterns can originate from specific projects or applications, but make sure you share them between different teams across the organization for efficient and consistent application of appropriate security solutions.

To increase adoption of these patterns, link them to the shared security services, or implement them into actual component solutions that can be easily integrated into an application during development. Support the key technologies within the organization, for instance in case of different development stacks. Treat these solutions as actual applications with proper support in case of questions or issues.

Have architects, senior developers and other technical stakeholders participate in design and creation of reference platforms. After creation, teams maintain ongoing support and updates.

Reference architectures may materialize into a set of software libraries and tools upon which project teams build their software. They serve as a starting point that standardizes the configuration-driven, security-by-default security approach. You can bootstrap the framework by selecting a particular project early in the lifecycle and having security-savvy staff work with them to build the security functionality in a generic way so that it can be extracted from the project and used elsewhere in the organization.

Monitor weaknesses or gaps in the set of security solutions available in your organization continuously in the context of discussions on architecture, development, or operations. This serves as an input to improve the appropriateness and effectiveness of the reference architectures that you have in place.

Identify relevant security requirements (i.e. expectations) for this functionality by reasoning on the desired confidentiality, integrity or availability of the service or data offered by the software project. Requirements state the objective (e.g., "personal data for the registration process should be transferred and stored securely"), but not the actual measure to achieve the objective (e.g., "use TLSv1.2 for secure transfer").

At the same time, review the functionality from an attacker perspective to understand how it could be misused. This way you can identify extra protective requirements for the software project at hand.

Security objectives can relate to specific security functionality you need to add to the application (e.g., "Identify the user of the application at all times") or to the overall application quality and behavior (e.g., "Ensure personal data is properly protected in transit"), which does not necessarily lead to new functionality. Follow good practices for writing security requirements. Make them specific, measurable, actionable, relevant and time-bound (SMART). Beware of adding requirements too general-purpose to not relate to the application at hand (e.g., The application should protect against the OWASP Top 10). While they can be true, they don''t add value to the discussion.

Consequently, it is important to know and evaluate your suppliers on this front.

Carry out a vendor assessment to understand the strengths and weaknesses of your suppliers. Use a basic checklist or conduct interviews to review their typical practices and deliveries. This gives you an idea of how they organize themselves and elements to evaluate whether you need to take additional measures to mitigate potential risks. Ideally, speak to different roles in the organization, or even set up a small maturity evaluation to this end. Strong suppliers will run their own software assurance program and will be able to answer most of your questions. If suppliers have weak competences in software security, discuss with them how and to what extent they plan to work on this and evaluate whether this is enough for your organization. A software supplier might be working on a low-risk project, but this could change.

It is important that your suppliers understand and align to the risk appetite and are able to meet your requirements in that area. Make what you expect from them explicit and discuss this clearly.

At this level, a more systematic elicitation of security requirements must be achieved by analysing different sources of such requirements. Ensure that appropriate input is received from these sources to help the elicitation of requirements. For example, organize interviews or brainstorm sessions (e.g., in the case of policy and legislation), analyze historical logs or vulnerability systems.

Use a structured notation of security requirements across applications and an appropriate formalism that integrates well with how you specify other (functional) requirements for the project. This could mean, for example, extending analysis documents, writing user stories, etc.

When requirements are specified, it is important to ensure that these requirements are taken into account during product development. Setup a mechanism to stimulate or force project teams to meet these requirements in the product. For example, annotate requirements with priorities, or influence the handling of requirements to enforce sufficient security appetite (while balancing against other non-functional requirements).

A quality requirement example is that they will deliver software that is protected against the OWASP Top 10, and in case issues are detected, these will be fixed. A task example is that they have to perform continuous static code analysis, or perform an independent penetration test before a major release. The agreement stipulates liabilities and caps in case an important issue arises.

Once you have implemented this for a few suppliers, work towards a standard agreement for suppliers that forms the basis of your negotiations. You can deviate from this standard agreement on a case by case basis, but it will help you to ensure you do not overlook important topics.

In case suppliers cannot meet the objectives that you have set, implement compensating controls so that, overall, you meet your objectives. Execute extra activities (e.g., threat modelling before starting the actual implementation cycle) or implement extra tooling (e.g., 3rd party library analysis at solution intake). The more suppliers deviate from your requirements, the more work will be required to compensate.

To achieve this, evaluate the impact of a breach in the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data or service. Consider using a set of 5-10 questions to understand important application characteristics, such as whether the application processes financial data, whether it is internet facing, or whether privacy-related data is involved. The application risk profile tells you whether these factors are applicable and if they could significantly impact the organization.

Next, use a scheme to classify applications according to this risk. A simple, qualitative scheme (e.g. high/medium/low) that translates these characteristics into a value is often effective. It is important to use these values to represent and compare the risk of different applications against each other. Mature highly risk-driven organizations might make use of more quantitative risk schemes. Don''t invent a new risk scheme if your organization already has one that works well.

It is typically done as part of the design phase or as part of a security assessment.

Threat modeling is a team exercise, including product owners, architects, security champions, and security testers. At this maturity level, expose teams and stakeholders to threat modeling to increase security awareness and to create a shared vision on the security of the system.

At maturity level 1, you perform threat modeling ad-hoc for high-risk applications and use simple threat checklists, such as STRIDE. Avoid lengthy workshops and overly detailed lists of low-relevant threats. Perform threat modeling iteratively to align to more iterative development paradigms. If you add new functionality to an existing application, look only into the newly added functions instead of trying to cover the entire scope. A good starting point is the existing diagrams that you annotate during discussion workshops. Always make sure to persist the outcome of a threat modeling discussion for later use.

Your most important tool to start threat modeling is a whiteboard, smartboard, or a piece of paper. Aim for security awareness, a simple process, and actionable outcomes that you agree upon with your team.

From a risk evaluation perspective, the basic set of questions is not enough to thoroughly evaluate the risk of all applications. Create an extensive and standardized way to evaluate the risk of the application, among others via their impact on information security (confidentiality, integrity and availability of data). Next to security, you also want to evaluate the privacy risk of the application. Understand the data that the application processes and what potential privacy violations are relevant. Finally, study the impact that this application has on other applications within the organization (e.g., the application might be modifying data that was considered read-only in another context). Evaluate all applications within the organization, including all existing and legacy ones.

Leverage business impact analysis to quantify and classify application risk. A simple qualitative scheme (such as high/medium/low) is not enough to effectively manage and compare applications on an enterprise-wide level.

Based on this input, Security Officers leverage the classification to define the risk profile to build a centralized inventory of risk profiles and manage accountability. This inventory gives Product Owners, Managers, and other organizational stakeholders an aligned view of the risk level of an application in order to assign appropriate priority to security-related activities.

Train your architects, security champions, and other stakeholders on how to do practical threat modeling.  Threat modeling requires understanding, clear playbooks and templates, organization-specific examples, and experience, which is hard to automate.

Your threat modeling methodology includes at least diagramming, threat identification, design flaw mitigations, and how to validate your threat model artifacts. Your threat model diagram allows a detailed understanding of the environment and the mechanics of the application. You discover threats to your application with checklists, such as STRIDE or more organization-specific threats. For identified design flaws (ranked according to risk for your organization), you add mitigating controls to support stakeholders in dealing with particular threats. Define what triggers updating a threat model, for example, a technology change or deployment of an application in a new environment.

Feed the output of threat modeling to the defect management process for adequate follow-up. Capture the threat modeling artifacts with tools that are used by your application teams.

Have a periodic review at an enterprise-wide level. Also, as your enterprise matures in software assurance, stimulate teams to continuously question which changes in conditions might impact the risk profile. For instance, an internal application might become exposed to the internet by a business decision. This should trigger the teams to rerun the risk evaluation and update the application risk profile accordingly.

In a mature implementation of this practice, train and continuously update teams on lessons learned and best practices from these risk evaluations. This leads to a better execution and a more accurate representation of the application risk profile.

The "Security Champion" has a set number of hours per week for Information Security related activities. They participate in periodic briefings to increase awareness and expertise in different security disciplines. "Security Champions" have additional training to help develop these roles as Software Security subject-matter experts. You may need to customize the way you create and support "Security Champions" for cultural reasons.

The goals of the position are to increase effectiveness and efficiency of application security and compliance and to strengthen the relationship between various teams and Information Security. To achieve these objectives, "Security Champions" assist with researching, verifying, and prioritizing security and compliance related software defects. They are involved in all Risk Assessments, Threat Assessments, and Architectural Reviews to help identify opportunities to remediate security defects by making the architecture of the application more resilient and reducing the attack threat surface.

In addition to assisting Information Security, "Security Champions" provide periodic reviews of all security-related issues for the project team so everyone is aware of the problems and any current and future remediation efforts. These reviews are leveraged to help brainstorm solutions to more complex problems by engaging the entire development team.

- Security Champions train on security topics from various phases of the SDLC. They receive the same training as developers and testers, but also understand threat modeling and secure design, as well as security tools and technologies that can be integrated into the build environment.

Include all training content from the Maturity Level 1 activities of this stream and additional role-specific and technology-specific content. Eliminate unnecessary aspects of the training.

Ideally, identify a subject-matter expert in each technology to assist with procuring or developing the training content and updating it regularly. The training consists of demonstrations of vulnerability exploitation using intentionally weakened applications, such as WebGoat or Juice Shop. Include results of the previous penetration as examples of vulnerabilities and implemented remediation strategies. Ask a penetration tester to assist with developing examples of vulnerability exploitation demonstrations.

Training is mandatory for all employees and contractors involved with software development, and includes an auditable sign-off to demonstrate compliance.

Gathered information provides a baseline for the organization to develop and promote its application security program. Items in the program are prioritized to address threats and opportunities most important to the organization. The baseline is split into several risk factors and drivers linked directly to the organization''s priorities and used to help build a risk profile of each custom-developed application by documenting how they can impact the organization if they are compromised.

The baseline and individual risk factors should be published and made available to application development teams to ensure a more transparent process of creating application risk profiles and incorporating the organization''s priorities into the program. Additionally, these goals should provide a set of objectives which should be used to ensure all application security program enhancements provide direct support of the organization''s current and future needs.

This way improvements are measurable and you can use them to secure future support and funding for the program. Considering the dynamic nature of most development environments, metrics should be comprised of measurements in the following categories

* `Effort` metrics measure the effort spent on security. For example training hours, time spent performing code reviews, and number of applications scanned for vulnerabilities.
* `Result` metrics measure the results of security efforts. Examples include number of outstanding patches with security defects and number of security incidents involving application vulnerabilities.
* `Environment` metrics measure the environment where security efforts take place. Examples include number of applications or lines of code as a measure of difficulty or complexity.

Each metric by itself is useful for a specific purpose, but a combination of two or three metrics together helps explain spikes in metrics trends. For example, a spike in a total number of vulnerabilities may be caused by the organization on-boarding several new applications that have not been previously exposed to the implemented application security mechanisms. Alternatively, an increase in the environment metrics without a corresponding increase in the effort or result could be an indicator of a mature and efficient security program.

While identifying metrics, it''s always recommended to stick to the metrics that meet several criteria

* Consistently Measured
* Inexpensive to gather
* Expressed as a cardinal number or a percentage
* Expressed as a unit of measure

Document metrics and include descriptions of best and most efficient methods for gathering data, as well as recommended methods for combining individual measures into meaningful metrics. For example, a number of applications and a total number of defects across all applications may not be useful by themselves but, when combined as a number of outstanding high-severity defects per application, they provide a more actionable metric.

In the roadmap, you reach a balance between changes requiring financial expenditures, changes of processes and procedures, and changes impacting the organization''s culture. This balance helps accomplish multiple milestones concurrently and without overloading or exhausting available resources or development teams. The milestones are frequent enough to help monitor program success and trigger timely roadmap adjustments.

While several measurements are useful for monitoring the information security program and its effectiveness, KPIs are comprised of the most meaningful and effective metrics. Aim to remove volatility common in application development environments from KPIs to reduce chances of unfavorable numbers resulting from temporary or misleading individual measurements. Base KPIs on metrics considered valuable not only to Information Security professionals but also to individuals responsible for the overall success of the application, and organization''s leadership. View KPIs as definitive indicators of the success of the whole program and consider them actionable.

Fully document KPIs and distribute them to the teams contributing to the success of the program as well as organization''s leadership. Ideally, include a brief explanation of the information sources for each KPI and the meaning if the numbers are high or low. Include short and long-term goals, and ranges for unacceptable measurements requiring immediate intervention.

In addition to reviewing the business drivers, the organization closely monitors the success of the implementation of each of the roadmap milestones. You evaluate the success of the milestones based on a wide range of criteria, including completeness and efficiency of the implementation, budget considerations, and any cultural impacts or changes resulting from the initiative. You review missed or unsatisfactory milestones and evaluate possible changes to the overall program.

The test objective is to validate that the security controls are correctly implemented.

The security testing validates the relevant software security controls. Perform control-verification security tests manually or with tools, each time the application changes its use of the controls. Techniques such as feature toggles and A/B testing can be used to progressively expose features to broader audiences as they are sufficiently validated. Software control verification is mandatory for all software that is part of the SAMM program.

The advantage of fuzz testing is the simplicity of the test design, and its lack of preconceptions about system behavior. The stochastic approach results in bugs that human eyes or structured testing would often miss. It is also one of the few means of assessing the quality of a closed system (such as a SIP phone). The simplicity of fuzzing a target is offset by the difficulty in accurately detecting and triaging crashes. Favour existing fuzzing tools and frameworks to leverage their supporting tooling.

To have a successful testing program, you must know the testing objectives, specified by the security requirements.

Derive security test cases for the applications in scope from the security requirements created as part of the "Security Requirements" SAMM security practice. To validate security requirements with security tests, security requirements are function-driven and highlight the expected functionality (the what) and, implicitly, the implementation (the how). These requirements are also referred to as "positive requirements", since they state the expected functionality that can be validated through security tests. Examples of positive requirements include "the application will lockout the user after six failed login attempts" or "passwords need to be a minimum of six alphanumeric characters". The validation of positive requirements consists of asserting the expected functionality. You can do it re-creating the testing conditions and running the test according to predefined inputs. Show the results as as a fail or pass condition.

Often, it is most effective to use the project team''s time to build application-specific test cases, and publicly available resources or purchased knowledge bases to select applicable general test cases for security. Relevant development, security, and quality assurance staff review candidate test cases for applicability, efficacy, and feasibility. Derive the test cases during the requirements and/or design phase of the functionality. Testing the security requirements is part of the functional testing of the software.

Create misuse and abuse cases to misuse or exploit the weaknesses of controls in software features to attack an application. Use abuse-case models for an application to serve as fuel for identification of concrete security tests that directly or indirectly exploit the abuse scenarios.

Abuse of functionality, sometimes referred to as a "business logic attack", depends on the design and implementation of application functions and features. An example is using a password reset flow to enumerate accounts. As part of business logic testing, identify the business rules that are important for the application and turn them into experiments to verify whether the application properly enforces the business rule. For example, on a stock trading application, is the attacker allowed to start a trade at the beginning of the day and lock in a price, hold the transaction open until the end of the day, then complete the sale if the stock price has risen or cancel if the price dropped?

Security unit tests should verify dynamically (i.e., at run time) that the components function as expected and should validate that code changes are properly implemented.

A good practice for developers is to build security test cases as a generic security test suite that is part of the existing unit testing framework. A generic security test suite might include security test cases to validate both positive and negative requirements for security controls such as Identity, Authentication & Access Control, Input Validation & Encoding, User and Session Management, Error and Exception Handling, Encryption, and Auditing and Logging. Verify the correct execution of the security tests as early as possible. If feasible for example, consider the passing of security tests as part of merge requirements before allowing new code to enter the main code base. Alternatively, consider their passing a requirement for validating a build.

For security functional tests, use unit level tests for the functionality of security controls at the software component level, such as functions, methods, or classes. For example, a test case could check input and output validation (e.g., variable sanitation) and boundary checks for variables by asserting the expected functionality of the component.

Load testing tools generate synthetic traffic, allowing you to test the application''s performance under heavy load. One important test is how many requests per second an application can handle while remaining within its performance requirements. Testing from a single IP address is still useful as it gives an indication of how many requests an attacker must generate to impact the application.

Denial of service attacks typically result in application resource starvation or exhaustion. To determine if any resources can be used to create a denial of service, analyze each application resource to see how it can be exhausted. Prioritise actions unauthenticated user can do. Complement overall denial of service tests with security stress tests to perform actions or create conditions which cause delays, disruptions, or failures of the application under test.

Progressively increase the frequency of security tests and extend code coverage.

Application security testing can be performed statically, by inspecting an application''s source code without running it, or dynamically by simply observing the application''s behavior in response to various input conditions. The former approach is often referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST), the latter as Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST). A hybrid approach, known as Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST), combines the strengths of both approaches (at the cost of additional overhead) by dynamically testing automatically instrumented applications, allowing accurate monitoring of the application''s internal state in response to external input.

Many security vulnerabilities are very hard to detect without carefully inspecting the source code. While this is ideally performed by expert or peer review, it is a slow and expensive task. Although "noisier" and frequently less accurate than expert-led reviews, automated SAST tools are cheaper, much faster, and more consistent than humans. A number of commercial and free tools are able to efficiently detect sufficiently important bugs and vulnerabilities in large code bases.

Dynamic testing does not require application source code, making it ideal for cases where source code is not available. It also identifies concrete instances of vulnerabilities. Due to its "black-box" approach , without instrumentation, it is more likely to uncover shallow bugs. Dynamic testing tools need a large source of test data whose manual test generation is prohibitive. Many tools exist which generate suitable test data automatically, leading to more efficient security testing and higher quality results.

Select appropriate tools based on several factors, including depth and accuracy of inspection, robustness and accuracy of security test cases, available integrations with other tools, usage and cost model, etc. When selecting tools, use input from security-savvy technical staff as well as developers and development managers and review results with stakeholders.

Automated tools are effective at finding various types of vulnerabilities but can never replace expert manual review.

Code-level vulnerabilities in security-critical parts of software can have dramatically increased impact so project teams review high-risk modules for common vulnerabilities. Common examples of high-risk functionality include authentication modules, access control enforcement points, session management schemes, external interfaces, and input validators and data parsers. Teams can combine code-level metrics and focused automated scans to determine where best to focus their efforts. In practice, the activity can take many forms including pair programming and peer review, time-boxed security "pushes" involving the entire development team, or spontaneous independent reviews by members of a specialised security group.

During development cycles where high-risk code is changed and reviewed, development managers triage the findings and prioritize remediation appropriately with input from other project stakeholders.

Automated security testing tools have 2 important characteristics: Their false positive rate, i.e. the non-existent bugs and vulnerabilities they incorrectly report; their false negative rate, i.e. actual bugs and vulnerabilities which they fail to detect. As you mature in your use of automated testing tools, you strive to minimize their false positive and false negative rates. This maximizes the time development teams spend reviewing and addressing real security issues in their applications, and reduces the friction typically associated with using untuned automated security analysis tools.

Start by disabling tool support for technologies and frameworks you do not use and target specific versions where possible. This will increase execution speed and reduce the number spurious results reported. Rely on security tool champions or shared security teams to pilot the tools in coordination with a select group of motivated development teams. This will identify likely false positive findings to ignore or remove from the tools'' output. Identify specific security issues and anti-patterns and favor the best tool for detecting them.

Leverage available tool features to take application-specific and organizational coding styles, as well as technical standards into account. Many automated static analysis tools allow users to write their own rules or customize default analysis rules to the specific software interfaces in the project under test for improved accuracy and depth of coverage. For example, potentially dangerous input (aka tainted) can be marked as safe after it flows through a designated custom sanitization method.

Strategically, it is better to reliably detect a limited subset of security issues via automated tooling, and incrementally extend coverage than attempting to detect all known issues immediately. Once the tools have been sufficiently tuned, they can be made available to a more development teams. It is important to continuously monitor their perceived efficacy among development teams. In more advanced forms, machine learning techniques can be adopted to identify and automatically filter out likely false positives at scale.

Generally, this happens during the testing phase prior to release and includes both static and dynamic manual penetration testing. In cases where software cannot be realistically tested outside of production, use of techniques such as blue-green deployments or A/B testing can allow ring-fenced security testing in production.

Penetration testing cases include both application-specific tests to check soundness of business logic, and common vulnerability tests to check the design and implementation. Once specified, security-savvy quality assurance or development staff can execute security test cases. The central software security group monitors first-time execution of security test cases for a project team to assist and coach the team security champions.

Many organizations offer "Bug Bunty" programmes which invite security researchers to find vulnerabilities in applications and report them responsibly in exchange for rewards. The approach allows organizations to access a bigger pool of talent, especially those lacking sufficient internal capacity or requiring the additional assurance.

Prior to release or mass deployment, stakeholders review results of security tests and accept the risks indicated by failing security tests at release time. Establish a concrete timeline to address the gaps over time. Spread the knowledge of manual security testing and the results across the development team to improve security knowledge and awareness inside the organization.

Configure security testing tools to automatically run as part of the build and deploy process to make this scalable with low overhead. Inspect findings as they occur.

Conducting security tests as early as the requirements or design phases can be beneficial. While traditionally used for functional test cases, this type of test-driven development approach involves identifying and running relevant security test cases early in the development cycle. With the automatic execution of security test cases, projects enter the implementation phase with a number of failing tests for the non-existent functionality. Implementation is complete when all the tests pass. This provides a clear, upfront goal for developers early in the development cycle, lowering risk of release delays due to security concerns or forced acceptance of risk to meet project deadlines.

Make the results of automated and manual security tests visible via dashboards, and routinely present them to management and business stakeholders (e.g. before each release) for review. If there are unaddressed findings that remain as accepted risks for the release, stakeholders and development managers work together to establish a concrete timeframe for addressing them. Continuously review and improve the quality of the security tests.

Consider and implement security test correlation tools to automate the matching and merging of test results from dynamic, static, and interactive application scanners into one central dashboard, providing direct input towards Defect Management. Spread the knowledge of the created security tests and the results across the development team to improve security knowledge and awareness inside the organization.

With the multiplicity of security tools running at every phase of development, remediating security issues at a designated stage (such as pre-release testing) is no longer appropriate or desirable. Security issues must be quickly triaged and fixes planned in a tradeoff between risk and cost of remediation. Continuously striving to detect issues earlier in the development lifecycle, via specific, low-friction automated tests integrated into development tools and build processes, lowers the cost of remediation thereby increasing the likelihood of issues being quickly resolved.

Proactively improve the security testing effort integrated into the development process by adequately propagating the results of other security test activities. For example, if a security penetration test identifies issues with session management, any changes to session management should trigger explicit security tests before pushing the changes to production.

Security champions and the central secure software group continuously review results from automated and manual security tests during development, including these results as part of the security awareness trainings for the development teams. Integrate lessons learned in overall playbooks to improve security testing as part of the organization development. If there are unaddressed findings that remain as accepted risks for the release, stakeholders and development managers should work together to establish a concrete timeframe for addressing them.
